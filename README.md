# Chastity Cage Options

Documenting some options for locking up a well endowed sub.

## Ball Trap Options

There is most likely a `goldilocks` combination of cage length, ring size, and possibly a support strap.

### Cage Options

After trying cages for years, Kink3d cobra has been my favorite so far.

* Easy to clean
* can be worn easily for a week between cleanings
* lightweight
* curved ring and tube design points the cage down instead of forward (easy to conceal)

#### Cage Products

   * Use this to figure out what ring sizes and cage lengths work
   * Comes with range of curved rings to find a fit
   * Budget price but perfectly usable
   * Close to a real Kink3d Cobra
   * US Seller quick ship
* [Kink3d Cobra Official ~ $150](https://kink3d.com/)
   * Smoother material
   * Better finish
   * Long term get one if the knockoff works out


### Support Straps

Some have had success with support straps. Most likely worth trying.

> Hi, My cage is not falling but sometimes when i get erected it moves forward with my sack and when i get flaccid it stays like hanging due to its weight but my penis is not escaping.
> so i decided to buy a auxiliary belt attached it to my cage and put it around my waist keep my chastity cage in a one place without hanging and i dont need to correct it all the time but im curious do they actually work anyone using them?

> I’ve been using one we bought on Etsy. It’s an elastic, nylon strap with a couple of snap buttons. It keeps everything in place. Nocturnal erections don’t push it away from the body. Everything stays in place nicely. 

Examples of support straps:
