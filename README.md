# Chastity Cage Options

Documenting some options for locking up a well endowed sub.

## Ball Trap Options

There is most likely a `goldilocks` combination of cage length, ring size, and possibly a support strap.

Ball trap devices really come down to trial and error - finding the right combo of cage length and ring size where the cage doesn't slip down and is comfortable.

### Device Options

After trying cages for years, `Kink3d cobra` has been my favorite so far. The `Cherry Keeper` is pretty good too and used that for a couple years.

* Easy to clean
* can be worn easily for a week between cleanings
* lightweight
* curved ring and tube design points the cage down instead of forward (easy to conceal)

  * Order a white one - Usually have to sand it
  * and then use RIT Dye it a color (sanding jacks up the color finish)

### Support Straps

Some have had success with support straps. Most likely worth trying.

> Hi, My cage is not falling but sometimes when i get erected it moves forward with my sack and when i get flaccid it stays like hanging due to its weight but my penis is not escaping.
> so i decided to buy a auxiliary belt attached it to my cage and put it around my waist keep my chastity cage in a one place without hanging and i dont need to correct it all the time but im curious do they actually work anyone using them?

> I’ve been using one we bought on Etsy. It’s an elastic, nylon strap with a couple of snap buttons. It keeps everything in place. Nocturnal erections don’t push it away from the body. Everything stays in place nicely.
